# 1 # Accepting and buffering multiple connections

# 2 # Parsing an HTTP request line	(p 169)

	If you send a request that the web server doesn't support, then the server should respond
	with a 400 Bad Request code.	

	- GET is used when the client wants to download a resource.
	
	- POST is used when the client needs to send information to the server. Your web
	browser typically uses a POST request when you submit an online form, for
	example. A POST request will typically cause a web server to change its state
	somehow. A web server could send an email, update a database, or change a file
	in response to a POST request

	- DELETE is used to request that the web server should delete a document or
	resource. Again, in practice, DELETE is rarely used. POST is commonly used to
	communicate web server updates of all types


	request format:
		- Each line of an HTTP message ends with a carriage return followed by a newline character: \r\n
		- The web client must send a blank line after the HTTP request header : \r\n\r\n
	
		ex:
			GET /page1.htm HTTP/1.1		//request line
			User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
			Accept-Language: en-US
			Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
			Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
			Host: example.com
			Connection: Keep-Alive

		request line: GET /page1.htm HTTP/1.1	
			- three part separate by space
			- type (ici GET)
			- document path ( /page1.htm)
			- protocol (HTTP/1.1)

		header field: name followed by a colon and then its value.
	





# 3 # Formatting an HTTP response

	response format: (page 172)

		ex:
			HTTP/1.1 200 OK
			Cache-Control: max-age=604800
			Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
			Date: Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:46:09 GMT
			Etag: "1541025663+gzip"
			Expires: Fri, 21 Dec 2018 16:46:09 GMT
			Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT
			Server: ECS (ord/5730)
			Vary: Accept-Encoding
			X-Cache: HIT
			Content-Length: 1270
			<!doctype html>
			<html>
			<head>
				<title>Example Domain</title>
			..

		status line :
			- protocol version (HTTP/1.1)
			- response code (200) ou (404)
			- response code description (OK) ou (Page not found)
