# Cool Layout with Complex Chainable Animation

Based on addition of just 2 classes with JS (and simple hover) this demo features a lot of cool chaining animations, combined with good performance and sort-of easy-to-maintain scss.

!!! PLEASE BETTER CHECK IN FIREFOX AND READ WHY BELOW !!!

Important note - after some changes in Chrome, which happened somewhere around September, the performance of this demo drastically reduced. I did some optimizations with adding will-change to some things, but it's still laggy as hell, even on a good machine. Originally, when it was created in July, it was working perfectly fine (as it works right now in FF, just tested in 50.1.0 version).
